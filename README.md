### Calender with CPP

This project will help you to learn how to print calendar for a specific year. The user can get the whole calendar by just typing the required year as an input. However, the code is explained with comments in the source code as it goes further. It displays a nicely formatted calendar of every month of a requested year. 

This project is one of my lab works when I was a sophomore in University. Fell free to play with the source code and upgrade this project as per your need. **Do not submit it as it is, as a part of your project.**
